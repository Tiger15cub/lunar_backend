# Lunar Backend - Type Script rewrite

### Notes:
- some code is pasted as i didnt had enough time during development to do them on my own
- also the backend has a terrible code base meaning it needs lot of improvements
- then we got the mcp issues it has, as you might noticed while playing lunar the backend gave ppl skins for free, had revision errors and more.
- so if you want to learn about this topic this might be a good start as it good many stuff but you have to make some stuff on your own and fix stuff.
- Reason why i open source this? Im working on a new Backend called gold witch has all written by me and also work correctly for Eclipse witch will stay closed source ^^

### Missing:
- Vantage: the xmpp server designed to work with the backend
- Titanium: the matchmaker for matchmaking ofc.
